# GMTK Game Jam 2025 Stats

I've made this small web page over the weekend so I could check what other card games were submitted to this jam.
Plus while I was at it, added filters over more different fields I was interested in.

All data is freely available and was taken from [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025/results) (see ``crawler/`` scripts).
If you want it in JSON format, check ``webapp/public/data.json``.
